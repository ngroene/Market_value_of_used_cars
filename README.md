# Market Value of Used Cars
 In this data science project, I determine the market value of used BMW 116 in Germany based on 500 online ads.
 Data was collected in early 2020 via web scrapping with BeatifulSoup.
 Fair market value is determined via a linear regression model including features such as age of car, mileage, Co2 emissions etc.
